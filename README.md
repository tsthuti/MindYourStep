# Mind Your Step ðŸŒ±
An interactive game designed to tackle critical challenges in early learning.

Our game addresses the lack of access to early educational opportunities in the absence of parental guidance. We believe **childhood** is the most crucial stage of life, as it lays the foundation for how an individual will navigate and experience the rest of their journey. Whether it be memories filled with laughter and joy or those of isolation and sadness, our childhood experiences have allowed us to develop into the people we are. 

Skills learned by playing the game include:
1. Financial Literary
2. Cybersecurity and how to protect sensitive information
3. Responsibility
4. Recognizing and avoiding dangers
5. Personal hygiene
